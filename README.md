# üß† Predicting Obesity Risk Using NHANES Data and Machine Learning

This repository presents a data-driven obesity classification system built using health and lifestyle survey data from **NHANES**. The modeling pipeline, developed in **R**, integrates **feature selection**, **cross-validation**, and **hyperparameter tuning** across multiple algorithms to classify individuals into five distinct obesity categories.

---

## üìã Project Summary

Obesity is a growing global health crisis. This project analyzes over 7,800 individual records from the U.S. NHANES dataset (2011‚Äì2018) to predict obesity classes with high accuracy. Models are trained using a combination of physiological, behavioral, and biochemical features.

---

## üéØ Goals

* Clean, integrate, and preprocess multi-cycle NHANES datasets (2011‚Äì2018)
* Engineer physiological features such as Body Water and Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR)
* Impute missing values using MICE
* Apply Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) to reduce dimensionality
* Tune hyperparameters using grid/random search with cross-validation
* Compare classification performance across five machine learning models
* Deliver interpretable and reproducible results in R

## üß† Models Used

All models were implemented and tuned in **R** using the `caret`, `e1071`, `randomForest`, `class`, and `nnet` packages.

### üìä Machine Learning Algorithms

| Model                                    | Tuned Parameters                  |
| ---------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| **Polytomous Logistic Regression (PLR)** | ‚Äì                                 |
| **Decision Tree (rpart)**                | `cp`, `maxdepth`                  |
| **Random Forest**                        | `mtry`                            |
| **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**         | `C`, `sigma`                      |
| **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**            | `k`, with preprocessing (scaling) |

Each model was optimized using **k-fold cross-validation** and **grid search**.

## üß¨ Feature Selection (RFE)

Feature selection was performed using Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) with **Polytomous Logistic Regression** as the base model. Predictors (excluding categorical variables) and the target variable `Obesity_Category` were defined. A 3-fold cross-validation was used to assess feature subsets. The selected features, along with summary metrics and performance visualizations, helped improve model efficiency and reduce overfitting.

## üìà Evaluation Metrics

Model performance was evaluated using:

* Accuracy
* Macro and Weighted Precision
* Macro and Weighted Recall
* Macro and Weighted F1-Score
* Confusion Matrix
* Feature Importance Plots (for tree-based models)

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Workflow & Pipeline

1. **Data Cleaning & Filtering**

   * Remove individuals under 18 and pregnant participants
   * Eliminate highly correlated features (e.g., BMI, Waist, Hip)
   * Harmonize data across NHANES cycles

2. **Missing Data Imputation**

   * Use `mice` with Predictive Mean Matching (PMM)
   * Apply Multinomial Logistic Regression for categorical data

3. **Feature Engineering**

   * Compute `Body_Water` and `BMR`

4. **Feature Selection**

   * Perform RFE with 3-fold CV using PLR

5. **Model Training & Tuning**

   * k-fold Cross-Validation
   * Hyperparameter tuning via Grid/Random Search

* **Language:** R ‚â• 4.1
* **Key Packages:**

  * Modeling: `caret`, `randomForest`, `e1071`, `nnet`, `class`
  * Imputation: `mice`
  * Visualization: `ggplot2`, `forcats`, `stringr`
